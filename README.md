## Requirements

**Motivation**: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods often overlook the topological structure of state transitions, which can carry rich information critical for learning better policies, especially in episodic environments like dialogue systems.

**Problem**: Most graph representation learning (GRL) methods are transductive and fail to generalize to unseen states, limiting their use in dynamic RL settings.

**Novelty 1**: Introduced topological state representations by modeling state transitions as a graph, capturing structural patterns beyond raw features.

**Novelty 2**: Proposed an inductive GRL framework by applying clustering on the transition graph before learning embeddings, enabling generalization to unseen or dynamic states.

Novelty 3: Designed a task-aware fine-tuning mechanism using TD error to dynamically update state embeddings based on task-specific feedback.

## ðŸ”¹ Framework Features 

- **State Transition Graph Construction**  
  - Constructed a directed graph where **nodes represent states** and **edges capture observed transitions** in the environment.

- **Graph Clustering**  
  - Applied **unsupervised clustering** (K-means) to group **topologically similar states**, reducing graph size and sparsity.

- **Inductive Graph Representation Learning (GRL)**  
  - Employed **GraphSAGE and Node2Vec** to learn **node embeddings**.

- **Dimensionality Reduction before GRL**  
  - Performed **clustering before GRL** to reduce the number of nodes, allowing more efficient and stable embedding learning over **cluster-level graphs** and enabling generalization of GRL to **unseen or dynamically emerging states**.

- **TD Errorâ€“Based Fine-Tuning**  
  - Introduced a **task-aware dynamic update** mechanism using **temporal difference (TD) error** to fine-tune embeddings during training.

- **Support for Episodic Environments**  
  - Designed for **episodic, sparse-reward RL tasks**, such as **goal-oriented dialogue systems**, where topological structure provides critical guidance.
